        <h3>Owner & Founder</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Jane is a Licensed Professional Counselor as well as owner and founder of Brighter Days Therapy and Consultation. She is an advocate and forever student of the healing impacts of mental and emotional wellness. She is proud to say that working as a licensed professional counselor is both her passion and profession. When she is not providing therapy, she can be found spending quality time dancing in the living room with her daughter, taking long nature walks, reading up on new therapeutic interventions, and listening to A LOT of music. <br><br>

            Jane embraces the concept of “the growth mindset” and implements this practice while engaging in play therapy or traditional CBT therapy. Jane truly believes that anyone is capable of learning how to use life's challenges as a platform for self compassion and emotional resilience. <br><br>
            Jane earned her undergraduate degree in Psychology, and earned her Masters Degree in Clinical Mental Health Counseling. Throughout her career, Jane has had the opportunity to support kids, tweens, teens, and adults in various environments and diverse communities. Jane has served as a paraprofessional within the Alexandria City Public School System for children with emotional disabilities, learning differences, and autism spectrum disorder. Jane has also served as a therapeutic day treatment counselor within the classroom setting, and has also provided therapy as an intensive in-home counselor, and outpatient counselor within the Northern Virginia community. With over 10 years of clinical experience within the mental health field, Jane continues to remain committed to helping kids, tweens, teens, and their families embrace emotional and mental wellness, and personal growth.</p>
